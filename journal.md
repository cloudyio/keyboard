I did basic research on what goes into making a low profile keyboard and the differences when designing it, i decided on a wired keyboard since i want it to be small and it is generally just easier to design a wired one, i also found a 75% to be the best for me. Picture of layout below:

Did more research and resetup kicad, i looked through a bunch of boards and found the nice!nano, the nice!nano honestly seemed great for the build but costing arround 30$ for a microcontroller seemed like a bad idea, i went back to look for another board and ended up finding this:

[Supermini NRF52840](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006019812115.html)
This is a really alternative to the nice nano, it is considered Nice!Nano compatible meaning any info i find on the nice!nano will be relevant to this board, also significantly cheaper then the other board coming in at ï¿¡7.79

One of the main reasons i really like this board is the fact it is bluetooth and has charging managment, making my life much easier and brings bluetooth back as an option.

I also did look for a dongle reciver and stumbled across the [nRF52840 Dongle](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-Dongle), it is zmk compatible which is one of the main reasons its good but i dislike the bulkyness and think ill keep looking
