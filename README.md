The keyboard is a small low profile keyboard made to be wireless and bluetooth, it features a lily 58 key layout, 110mAh battery and 2 nice!nano alternative controllers

The keyboard uses ZMK for its firmware due to how simple but effective it is for ergo and bluetooth keyboards.

## Why i made the project

Ive wanted to try out a ergo keyboard for a while now and thought it would be a fun idea to make one with the features i actually want and none of the extra parts.
